                        <h3>General Facts About Music Education</h3>
                        <p>There exists a common misconception that if one has not learnt to play a musical instrument by a certain age then he/she never will. According to us, No one is too old to learn to play music. It is true that young people absorb learning and instruction more quickly and easily than adults, but the fact is that mature age students have the advantages of greater concentration and genuine interest. <br><br>It is important to keep in mind though, that adults have less time on their hands than young people and getting the most out of music lessons takes regular practice. Playing in a band or making a career out of music may not be your reason for taking music lessons. However, great personal satisfaction and a real sense of achievement are two of the benefits that can be gained from your involvement with music lessons.</p>

                        <h3>Choosing the Right Instrument for you or your Child</h3>
                        <p>If you are thinking of learning to play an instrument, the vast array of musical instruments to choose from can be both daunting and overwhelming, particularly for a beginner. Every instrument has its own unique rewards and difficulties. You may find that some instruments are easier to play at first than others but ultimately, no instrument is easier or more difficult to play well than any other. <br><br>It may be wise to consider the type of instrument you or your child have always wanted to play or what type of music you or your child listen to and enjoy before making your decision. Another thing to keep in mind is that the cost of an instrument should never be a deterrent to starting music lessons. Etude school of music has a comprehensive music instrument and equipment catalogue catering to student requirements.</p>

                        <h3>Learning To Read Music</h3>
                        <p>At Etude School of Music, it is our belief that learning to read music is an important and valuable skill for a musician. Learning to read music is in fact much easier to learn than most people believe is possible and is a significant step toward eventually being able to play, sing or even write any song you want.<br><br>Additionally, Learning to read music gives a musician or student access to many thousands of tunes gathered over the years. Whether it is classical, folk, jazz, hip-hop, reggae, techno or rock, music is recognised and written in the same way throughout the world.</p>

                        <h3>Lessons And Practice</h3>
                        <p>Music education consists of 4 basic elements.</p>
                               <ul>
                                <li>Developing technique through lessons and practice</li>
                                 <li>Developing your musical understanding (Training your ears)</li>
                                   <li>Developing your practical musicianship by playing with others</li>
                                   <li>Developing your confidence by playing or performing in front of others</li>
                               </ul>

                        <h3>How Long It takes To Master Your Instrument?</h3>
                        <p>The length of time that it takes to learn and master an instrument is dependent on your own effort and commitment. The greater the effort and commitment, the more rapid the progress. Learning an instrument is an ongoing process. Even music teachers and the finest performers in the world are still learning.<br><br>Beginner classes are designed to get you started in the right direction and provide a foundation for you to get you playing and enjoying your instrument - in just 12 sessions.</p>

                        <h3>Exam Accreditation</h3>
                        <p>In both Classical and Rock-Pop streams, the only widely recognised qualification for students is the graded examination. Students wishing to make careers of music generally pass through several graded examinations measuring musicianship, technique and theoretical knowledge before going on to take any performing or teaching assignments. Examinations are a way of measuring musical progress, but they are not the only method - and they are not for every student!<br><br>At Etude School of Music, we provide proper guidance about various graded examinations and leave the decision of whether or not to sit an exam entirely up to teacher and student, or teacher and parent.</p>
